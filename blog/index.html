            <p>A user interface that I use very often is instagram. I am on instagram so many times a day I can't keep count. I enjoy it because it is mainly visuals with a little bit of text. The photos are large enough to take up the full screen of my phone and the design is simple, mainly black and white text for comments and likes. The colors really come from the users' photos and posts.</p>
            <p>It's also a great medium for creativity. The interface is so simple that it allows for the users to do a lot of the designing of it. It's also very easy to use becuase of its simplicity. The image to the left is a screenshot I grabbed off of my phone. You can see the simplified icons and clean black and white scheme. The color of the interface is coming from the photo that a user has posted. </p>
