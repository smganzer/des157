                    way too cute to ignore!</p>

                <p class="text">my younger sister got me this sticker a couple years back. <a href="http://www.woodwardtahoe.com/">woodward</a> is an extreme sports camp with locations across the US. my sister went for park skiing and brought me back a stack of these
                    stickers. I love using them because then it looks like I'm some kind of extreme athlete.</p>

                <p class="text">I got this sticker in hale'iwa, hawaii on one of my many visits. it was from the patagonia store we stopped at. the cashier said you can't get that sticker anywhere online or in person except from his store. I haven't put it on anything
                    because I feel like it's too valuable to waste.</p>

                <p class="text">this sticker reminds me of the first time I enjoyed beer. it's not my favorite brewery or anything, that's definitely lagunitas. but I got this sticker at the brewfest on campus late in the summer. I was a young, fresh 21 year old and the brewfest taught me to love beer. now I think of it and this sticker I got there fondly.</p>
