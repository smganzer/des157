                    way too cute to ignore! and now I have a piece of Keith Haring art to put wherever I want.</p>

                <p class="text">my younger sister got me this sticker a couple years back. <a href="http://www.woodwardtahoe.com/">woodward</a> is an extreme sports camp with locations across the US. my sister went for park skiing and brought me back a stack of these
                    stickers. I love using them because then it looks like I'm some kind of extreme athlete.</p>

                <p class="text">I got this sticker in hale'iwa, hawaii on one of my many visits. it was from the patagonia store we stopped at. the cashier said you can't get that sticker anywhere online or in person except from his store. I haven't put it on anything
                    because I feel like it's too valuable to waste.</p>

                <p class="text">this sticker reminds me of the first time I enjoyed beer. it's not my favorite brewery, that's lagunitas. but I got this sticker at the brewfest on campus in the summer. I was a young, fresh 21 year old and the brewfest taught me to love
                    beer. now I think of it and this sticker I got there fondly.</p>

                <p class="text">this sticker can be seen on almost every car where I'm from so it's kind of nice to keep it to myself in davis. I'm from placerville, a small town on the way up to tahoe so this sticker reminds me of home. it also is made up of my favorite
                    color, blue.</p>
