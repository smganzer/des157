    <p><strong>Q:</strong> How will your users understand the content of the project?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> The content will be placed in clearly labeled pages that can be found in the navigation of the site. The content will be bulleted for the most part for quick, easy reading since the audience is a group of children with short attention
        spans and lower vocabulary than the average adult.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> How will your users understand the primary objectives?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> The obejectives will be found in the name or slogan (yet to be determined) and will have the word anti-bully or concept of positivity intertwinded it it. The slogan would be something like "putting and end to bullies" or "making
        campus a positive place for students." The description of the app at the app store will explain its purpose and there could be a page on the site and app titled "about" to learn about the movement this site is creating.</p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What content and features do your users need, and in what form do they need it?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> They need simple version of a profile, a posting method, and a form to report abuse or bullying. They also need an informational page about what to do if you're a bully or if you're being bullied. </p>

    <p><strong>Q:</strong> How do your users think your interactive projects should work and what are their experience levels with the type of media you are creating?</p>
    <p><strong>A:</strong> Kids this age are usually tech savvy and probably have a facebook, instagram or twitter. This would be a simplified version of those sites with a bigger purpose. The users think the projects shoudl work fast and simple. They shouldn't
        be getting confused or using the site for bad behavior. They might be better at navigating the site than adults because they've grown up in this tech age.</p>
